#### About Me
I am one of two instructors of Engineering and Robotics at the Medford Vocational Technical High School. Mr. Lewkowitz and I divide the instruction of the shop into CAD and machinging, and programming and electronics respectively. Students spend four years in our program. The first two years learning to write code, design in CAD, build electronic circuits and machine. The second two years, they build whatever they want. Each week students are required to present a blog post covering their work. After eleven years of teaching, they finally convinved me to make my own weekly blog posts and present along with them. Here is that work.
