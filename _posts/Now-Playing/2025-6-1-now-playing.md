For a long time, I have been meaning to upgrade the small paper "Now Playing" sign infront of the cover of the album on the record playing. Having some experience cutting cabinet handels out of floor tiles on the waterjet, I decided to try and cut letters.

Mostly these were birthday cards for my family but a few were holiday cards. I made them out of sturdy 110lb paper. I also added modgepodge and a polyurethane sealer after they were finished.

My first project is to repair a Christmas paper craft card (see below) that is in such bad shape that it needs to be rebuilt completely.

## Step One

The first step is getting all my old tools together. Almost all of the work is done with pencil and the standard Xacto knife you see below. All of the design, drawing and cutting with very few exceptions is done freehand. I will use a straight edge to create parallel lines if I need letters to be similar height and I will cut with a straight
