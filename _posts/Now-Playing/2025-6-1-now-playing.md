For a long time, I have been meaning to upgrade my small paper "Now Playing" sign used to indicate which album is on the record player. Having some experience cutting cabinet handels out of floor tiles on the waterjet, I decided to try cutting letters. Cutting ceramics on the waterjet is tricky as the jet tends to crack the tile each time it starts a line. (See below) But by  carefully setting the lead-ins and puncture pressure, I was able to cut all the letters fairly easily.

The other problem is that small objects tend to fall through the metal slats after cutting. The bottom of the waterjet pool is too deep to reach by hand, but I have set up a screen below the slats to catch letters when they fall through. 

Here you can see a few letters.

And here you can see the final set of letters.
