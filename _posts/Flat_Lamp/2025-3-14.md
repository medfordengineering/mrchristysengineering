I call low warm lighting cozy. My wife calls it dark. As a result I have agreed to design a bright (though still warm) for our first floor, but because we already have two hanging lamps in the space, I want this one to almost disappear, essentially providing bright light from thin plate of metal.

The CAD design for the light is shown below. The plate is 44" long and 8" wide and includes the cutouts shown below.

Notice that there is a line in the middle of the sketch. This is because the enire piece is much too large to cut by itself on the waterjet. Below you can see the two pieces cut separately on the waterjet.
