In this post I am going to test the five sealers in order to determine which provides the most durable finish and secondly which is the easiest to apply. The line up includes, Powertex Universal Medium, Mod Poge Hard Coat, Dura Clear Polyurethane, Mod Podge Clear Acrylic Sealer, Bulls Eye Shellac, and Minwax Polycrylic. I will initially test three coats of each on the five Ts which are made from 110lb card stock.

After testing three coats, I was surprised to find that the Powertex resulted in by far the stiffest paper and most sturdy. Mod Podge Hard Coat, MinWax Polycrylic, Bulls Eye Shellac, and Mod Podge Arcylic were an equal second. Dura Clear Polyurethane came in third.
