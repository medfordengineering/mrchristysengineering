About a decade ago, I made about a dozen or so paper craft cards. Mostly these were birthday cards for my family but a few were holiday cards. I made them out of sturdy 110lb paper. I also added modgepodge and a polyurethane sealer after they were finished. The result was fairly study but as you can see (images below) still suffered damage. My plan is to rework each one and use a much stronger sealent to preserve them. My first test will be with [Powertex's transparent textile hardener.](https://powertexproductsusa.com/products/powertex-universal-medium-transparent-1000gr?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=1a4815e0c&pr_rec_pid=1447160873029&pr_ref_pid=1447100776517&pr_seq=uniform) If this does not work, I have heard the Minwax wood hardner is a good option.

My first project is to repair a Christmas paper craft card (see below) that is in such bad shape that it needs to be rebuilt completely.
