About a decade ago, I made about a dozen or so paper craft cards. Mostly these were birthday cards for my family but a few were holiday cards. I made them out of sturdy 110lb paper. I also added modgepodge and a polyurethane sealer after they were finished. The result was fairly study but as you can see still suffered damage. My plan is to rework each one and use a much stronger sealent to preserve them. My first test will be with Powertex's transparent textile hardener.
