A couple of years ago, I began gathering colored glass and small vases from Goodwill. When I had a good collection, I combined them with a couple of sets of outdoor string lights to make colored lights for our backyard.

I drilled a hole in each of the glasses using glass hole saws. I then cut off each light in the string placed the socket in the glass and soldered them back together using waterproof solder seal connectors.

Here they are in the day light.

And here they are at night.
